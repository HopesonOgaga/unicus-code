            ive honed my coaching techniques over the decades.i aim to
            communicate openly and clearly,addressing critical points and
            providng continous constructiove feedback.

              The process starts with clearly defined objectives. How will you
              know how to change if you don’t know what needs changing. We’ll
              develop your goals in conversation together.

            <p>growth</p>
            <p>
              The growth stage is the meat in the sandwich. It is here that you
              put new strategies to work, and begin addressing the issues that
              have been holding you back.

            <p>reflection</p>
            <p>
              At this point in the process I ask you to reflect on the changes
              you’ve made, and whether you’re satisfied with there the results
              have led you. After this, we can address sustainability.

            “Oving helped me regain my confidence after being fired and helped
            me find a healthy routine that put me on track towards changing my
            career path. Now, I’m doing something that I always wanted to do.” –

            “I struggled with all the new things that I was expected to do as an
            adult. Taxes, work – the stuff they don’t teach you at school. I
            gained confidence, started taking more chances, and am even working
            towards getting into college.” – Neil Grimston

            I believe we all have the power to change our lives within us. I
            also believe there is no shame in asking for help to deliver such
            change.
